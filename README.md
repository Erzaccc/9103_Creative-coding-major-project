Individual final code

1. There is no interaction design in my work, it is an intuitive animated visual effect.

2. 
(1)I chose Perlin Noise to drive my personal code.
Because the artwork we have chosen is Piet Mondrian 'Broadway Boogie Woogie'.

(2)So I want my images to be more rhythmic, to make it look more musical. So I made the 'road' part like a color block cycle overla p feeling. Then let the 'building' part moving, scale and change in transparency. Make it look more layered.

(3)My initial creation of perlin noise for this of artwork was limited to color changes and size scaling. I think it's kind of boring. So when I see the panning and sliding of the color blocks and lines in the video. It just occurred to me that I could add offset effects to my creations. To enhance its sense of hierarchy.

(4)My code uses map, offset, Alpha, framecount to realize perlin noise of color, size, position, and different effects. It's all taught and learned techniques. It is mainly through framecount to control the number of frames to form animation effects.
